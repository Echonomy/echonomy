# Indie Tunes MVP

Indie tunes is a decentralized online record store that values familarity and simplicty.

Under the hood we use smart wallets and account abstraction. Most users will never know they are using a dapp.

## Decentralize
Enable artists to package their content in new and fairer ways without compromising on user experience.

## Engage
Artists post content to the platform in the same way they would upload a song to bandcamp. 

## Collab
Users can purchase using fiat/usdc. Artists who own the contract receive the money in their SAFE. 

## Reward
Artists have FanTokens which gate access to exclusive super fan content kind of like patreon.
Fan Tokens are issued to people who engage with the Artists posts on the platform and sharing on web2 social platforms.

## Preserve
All tunes are archived with filecoin and IPFS and are only accessible to people who own the tune NFT.
